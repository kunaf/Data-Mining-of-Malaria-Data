# Data-Mining-of-Malaria-Data

This file contains a code for association rule data mining of health data: Case of Malaria Data in the south west region of Cameroon.

This is code was submitted as part the author's research work for the award of a Masters degree in Software Engineering. 

This code assisted in the study of associations or relationships and patterns discovered while mining malaria data collected from 18 health districts in the south west region of Cameroon. The data set is not publicly available, it was provided to be used only for this study, hence, the data set is not made available in this repository. 

The data made available by the delegation of public health in Cameroon for this study was not sufficient and so the author had to generate synthetic data with a 
larger number of records. A compararison was made between the result of the study from the synthetic data and the original data and the results were found to be highly similar and correlated. 

# Project Abstract: 
Non-data mining techniques have been used to analyze malaria data and public health strategies have
been implemented based on these analyses to limit the impact of malaria. However, malaria is still
prevalent in our communities thus prompting further analyses of malaria data. This study adopts a data
mining technique: association rule mining, to analyze malaria data, and discover interesting
associations between malaria diagnosis and deaths, and between the medical personnel's hunch and
confirmatory malaria tests. Unlike other analysis carried out with non-data mining techniques, which
highlighted that the group at risk of death are patients aged 0â€“5 years and pregnant women, the
analyses of this study showed a strong association between malaria diagnosis and malaria deaths,
among patients aged 5 and above. Similar to other studies, the results also showed that a malaria test is
absolutely necessary to confirm malaria diagnosis. In another analyses, synthetic data was generated
from the real data and the same investigations carried out. The results from the synthetic data showed a
similar trend as that of the real data. Although children below the age of five and pregnant women have
been the focus of public health action in my community, this study suggests that attention should also
be paid to those above 5 years. The results of this study will contribute to the development of public
health strategies and inform policy in the fight against the spread of malaria.
